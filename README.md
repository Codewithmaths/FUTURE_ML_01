Overview
This project provides an end-to-end solution for sales data analysis and forecasting using Python and Power BI. It guides non-technical business users and analysts through:

Forecasting sales using Python (XGBoost)

Preparing and cleaning data for business reporting

Building an interactive Power BI dashboard to visualize:

Sales trends (actual vs. forecast)

Monthly & yearly comparisons

Top & low-performing periods

Key business metrics (KPIs)

Filterable breakdowns (when available)

Features
Machine Learning Forecast: Uses XGBoost for predictive sales modeling .

Interactive Dashboard: Built in Power BI for business exploration.

Clear Documentation: Step-by-step guides and code are included.

Structured Data Flow: From raw CSV through preprocessing to visualization.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
Power BI Desktop

Python 3.8+ (for forecasting, if desired)

See requirements.txt for Python package dependencies (pandas, numpy, xgboost, matplotlib, etc.) 

Data
Place your sales data as data/powerbi_sales_forecast_data.csv.
This data should include columns: Date, Sales, Category, Region, Store, etc.

How to Run Forecasting
Open notebooks/sale_forecasting_model.ipynb in Jupyter or VS Code.

Follow all notebook steps to:

Prepare features

Train the model (XGBoost)

Generate forecasted sales

Export results for use in Power BI

How to Use the Power BI Dashboard
Open dashboard/sales_dashboard.pbix with Power BI Desktop.

Update the data source if needed to point to your CSV or updated forecast file.

Explore the built-in visuals:

Sales trend lines (showing forecast vs. actual)

Filters by year, category, etc.

Monthly & yearly comparison charts

Insight cards for decision-making

Customization
If your data includes more detailed fields (e.g., product-level info), update the dashboard’s visuals accordingly.

Adjust forecast model parameters in the Python notebook as needed for improved accuracy.
