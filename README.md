## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔧 Prerequisites
- [✔] Power BI Desktop (Windows)
- [✔] Python 3.8+ with libraries listed in `requirements.txt`
- [✔] (Optional) Jupyter Notebook or VS Code

### 📥 Installation

1. **Clone the repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/sales-forecasting-dashboard.git
   cd sales-forecasting-dashboard
Install Python dependencies

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install -r requirements.txt
Place your sales data
Add your CSV file to the data/ folder and name it powerbi_sales_forecast_data.csv.

🧠 Forecasting with Python (XGBoost)
Open notebooks/sale_forecasting_model.ipynb.
Follow the notebook steps:
Load and clean the sales data
Engineer features (e.g., lag values, rolling means)
Train the XGBoost forecasting model
Export results to CSV for use in Power BI

📈 Power BI Dashboard
Open dashboard/sales_dashboard.pbix in Power BI Desktop.
Ensure the data source path matches your local setup (modify if needed).

Explore:
📉 Trend lines (actual vs forecast)
📆 Month-over-month & year-over-year comparisons
🔍 High/low performance periods
🎯 KPI cards and category breakdowns

🛠️ Customization
Tweak Power BI visuals or filters for your own business logic.
Modify or re-train the XGBoost model with additional data or hyperparameters.
Extend Python code with new features (e.g., holidays, promotions, weather impact).
